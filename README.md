# rbw

This is an unofficial command line client for
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). Although it does come with its own
[command line client](https://help.bitwarden.com/article/cli/), this client is
limited by being stateless - to use it, you're required to manually lock and
unlock the client, and pass the temporary keys around in environment variables,
which makes it very difficult to use. This client avoids this problem by
maintaining a background process which is able to hold the keys in memory,
similar to the way that `ssh-agent` or `gpg-agent` work. This allows the client
to be used in a much simpler way, with the background agent taking care of
maintaining the necessary state.

## Maintenance

I consider `rbw` to be essentially feature-complete for me at this point. While
I still use it on a daily basis, and will continue to fix regressions as they
occur, I am unlikely to spend time implementing new features on my own. If you
would like to see new functionality in `rbw`, I am more than happy to review
and merge pull requests implementing those features.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

`rbw` is available in the [community
repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rbw/).
Alternatively, you can install
[`rbw-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rbw-git/) from the AUR, which
will always build from the latest master commit.

### Debian/Ubuntu

You can download a Debian package from
[https://git.tozt.net/rbw/releases/deb/
](https://git.tozt.net/rbw/releases/deb/). The packages are signed by
[`minisign`](https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign), and can be verified using
the public key `RWTM0AZ5RpROOfAIWx1HvYQ6pw1+FKwN6526UFTKNImP/Hz3ynCFst3r`.

### Alpine

`rbw` is available in the [testing repository](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=rbw).
If you are not using the `edge` version of alpine you have to [enable the repository manually](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories#Testing).

### Other

With a working Rust installation, `rbw` can be installed via `cargo install
rbw`. This requires that the
[`pinentry`](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.en.html)
program is installed (to display password prompts).

## Configuration

Configuration options are set using the `rbw config` command. Available
configuration options:

* `email`: The email address to use as the account name when logging into the
  Bitwarden server. Required.
* `base_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden server to use. Defaults to the official
  server at `https://api.bitwarden.com/` if unset.
* `identity_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden identity server to use. If unset,
  will use the `/identity` path on the configured `base_url`, or
  `https://identity.bitwarden.com/` if no `base_url` is set.
* `notifications_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden notifications server to use.
  If unset, will use the `/notifications` path on the configured `base_url`,
  or `https://notifications.bitwarden.com/` if no `base_url` is set.
* `lock_timeout`: The number of seconds to keep the master keys in memory for
  before requiring the password to be entered again. Defaults to `3600` (one
  hour).
* `sync_interval`: `rbw` will automatically sync the database from the server
  at an interval of this many seconds, while the agent is running. Setting
  this value to `0` disables this behavior. Defaults to `3600` (one hour).
* `pinentry`: The
  [pinentry](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.html)
  executable to use. Defaults to `pinentry`.

## Usage

Commands can generally be used directly, and will handle logging in or
unlocking as necessary. For instance, running `rbw ls` will run `rbw unlock` to
unlock the password database before generating the list of entries (but will
not attempt to log in to the server), `rbw sync` will automatically run `rbw
login` to log in to the server before downloading the password database (but
will not unlock the database), and `rbw add` will do both.

Logging into the server and unlocking the database will only be done as
necessary, so running `rbw login` when you are already logged in will do
nothing, and similarly for `rbw unlock`. If necessary, you can explicitly log
out by running `rbw purge`, and you can explicitly lock the database by running
`rbw lock` or `rbw stop-agent`.

`rbw help` can be used to get more information about the available
functionality.

Run `rbw get <name>` to get your passwords. If you also want to get the username
or the note associated, you can use the flag `--full`. You can also use the flag
`--field={field}` to get whatever default or custom field you want. The `--raw`
flag will show the output as JSON.

*Note to users of the official Bitwarden server (at bitwarden.com)*: The
official server has a tendency to detect command line traffic as bot traffic
(see [this issue](https://github.com/bitwarden/cli/issues/383) for details). In
order to use `rbw` with the official Bitwarden server, you will need to first
run `rbw register` to register each device using `rbw` with the Bitwarden
server. This will prompt you for your personal API key which you can find using
the instructions [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/personal-api-key/).
