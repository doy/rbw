# Use as pinentry to store master password for rbw into keyring
# Usage
# - run "rbw-pinentry-keyring setup" once to save master password to keyring
# - add "rbw-pinentry-keyring" as "pinentry" in rbw config (${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/rbw/config.json)
# - use rbw as normal
# Notes
# - setup tested with pinentry-gnome3, but you can run the "secret-tool store"-command manually as well
# - master passwords are stored into the keyring as plaintext, so secure your keyring appropriately
# - supports multiple profiles, simply set RBW_PROFILE during setup
# - can easily be rewritten to use other backends than keyring by setting the "secret_value"-variable
